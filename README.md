## Special Interest Group for Simulation (SIG Simulation)

### Description of the SIG Simulation:
The Simulation SIG (Special Interest Group for Simulation) is a collection of individuals who are invested in the development and continuous improvement of the O3D engine related to **physics, animation, AI, robotics, and other topics related to simulation**. It is comprised of physics, animation, AI, and simulation experts, developers, game artist, and an array of community contributors. Anyone who cares about any aspect of O3DE regarding simulation is welcome to join.

### What the SIG Simulation Does:
- Review and contribute to simulation technology roadmap
- Review simulation related RFCs and PRs
- Ensure timely and frequent communication of simulation activities (including Discord, sig meetings, triage, PR review, RFCs, etc.)
- Ensure accurate measurement of simulation systems (testing and performance)
- Provide support to community for simulation topics
- Work with sig-core to unify, consolidate and maintain math libraries
- Work with sig-core to define tick (update) system
- Operational excellence on simulation technology (unit tests, end-to-end tests, benchmarks, documentation, tutorials)

### How to Contribute to SIG Simulation

As a contributor you can help in one of the following ways.
- Providing your feedback on designs as review them. As a user of O3DE your viewpoint brings another data point to the conversation. This allows the SIG Simulation to make sure we are covering all the interactions from multiple perspectives. This helps us to learn and grow.
- Our team is small and help is always welcome. So if you feel that you can help with developing O3DE's features related to simulation in any capacity, let us know and we will find a good way for us to collaborate. This can be in the form of helping with research, designing, helping to write/maintain our documentation, or working on issues.
- If you are an expert in a specific area like: game engines, Internet of Things (IoT), simulations or movies, we would love your help as a research participant. We can design great things by collaborating with the experts like you. Collecting feedback direct from our users can make O3DE great.
